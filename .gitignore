# Allowlisting gitignore template for GO projects prevents us
# from adding various unwanted local files, such as generated
# files, developer configurations or IDE-specific files etc.
# SEE: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/community/Golang/Go.AllowList.gitignore
# Recommended: Go.AllowList.gitignore

# Ignore EVERYTHING!!!

# But not these files...
!.gitignore
!launch.json
!*.go
!go.sum
!go.mod

!README.md
!LICENSE

# !Makefile

# ...even if they are in subdirectories
